# üå± True Root ‚Äî Traceability App (MVP)

**True Root** is a full-stack, mobile-first app that enables transparent lifecycle traceability for products across agricultural and factory-based supply chains. It leverages QR codes, event logging, and role-based access to ensure accountability from origin to end-user.

## üöÄ Project Goal

The goal of this MVP is to build a **modular, open-source system** where Producers, Exporters, Buyers, and Admins can:

- Record product batches and their transformations
- Log trace events (e.g., drying, packaging, shipping)
- Scan QR codes to view product history
- Access only the data relevant to their role
